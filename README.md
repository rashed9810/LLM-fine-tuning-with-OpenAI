## Introduction

The Large Language Model (LLM) offered by OpenAI is a powerful tool for natural language processing tasks. However, its true potential can be unlocked through fine-tuning on domain-specific data. This repository provides a framework and examples for custom tuning the LLM to suit your specific needs.

## Custom Tuning

Custom tuning involves adjusting the parameters and training process of the LLM to better suit a particular task or domain. This repository offers scripts and utilities to facilitate this process, allowing users to define their own objectives and train the model accordingly.

## Fine-Tuning Data

Included in this repository are sample datasets that can be used for fine-tuning the LLM. These datasets cover a range of domains and tasks, including:

- **JSON File**: Sample JSON data for custom fine-tuning tasks.
- **Medical Report CSV File**: An example CSV file containing medical report data for medical text generation tasks.

Feel free to use these datasets for experimentation and training.

## Usage

To get started with fine-tuning the LLM, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.
3. Prepare your fine-tuning data.
4. Use the provided scripts and utilities to customize and train the model.

For detailed instructions and examples, refer to the documentation provided in the `docs` directory.

## Examples

Check out the `examples` directory for demonstrations of fine-tuning the LLM on various tasks and datasets. These examples serve as templates for implementing your own custom tuning procedures.

## Contributing
